#YouTube Timer
A simple script I wrote to open YouTube for only a certain amount of time, then close. Only for personal use, really.

##Practical uses
I personally use it to have YouTube play for a few hours while I sleep, rather than play all night long. It could also be used to limit your time on YouTube for bandwidth purposes or if you have other things to do.
As it stands, it is set up to run by executing the script standalone. To use it through the terminal every time, just remove the terminal commands and un-quote the `'echo "Enter duration ... " ... '`, although I highly suggest just using keybinds or a menu item, as it's less tedious.

##Things to change for your own use
- Browser commands
- Preferred terminal
